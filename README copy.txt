# FEEDBACK ANALYSER

***

## Project Overview

Every company/brand wants to improve their products we can help them by finding the problems and best part of their product by using the user feedback . But when your product has bulk of reviews/feedbacks it gets difficult to figure out the main problem manually. So we need something more technical to figure out the problem.

### Domain Selected

WE SELECTED THE DOMAIN OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.

### Solution overview

Our product basically takes feedback of bulk data such as comments or reviews of products given by enormous number of people and filters feedback(like we can get data of specific field, like it can sort out review of hotels staff from bulk hotel reviews )


### Technologies used

PYTHON
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING

### Known Bugs
BUGS DETECTED IN NLTK.CORPUS.WORDNET PYTHON LIBRARY

### Source Code Directory structure
THE DIRECTORY CONSISTS OF 7 PYTHON SHELLS
THE TEST FILE SHOULD BE IN PARENT DIRECTORY IN .TXT FORMAT
SAMLE ARTICLES HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABE TO TEST THE SOFTWARE FOR DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES.


### Installation guide
WE CREATED THE SOFTWARE USING JUPYTER NOTEBOOK
- open Main file.ipynb
- first of all your input data(bulk review data and comments/* in our case its " hotel_test.txt ") should be in .txt format                           for using this model
- secondly you should place your inputext file in a parent folder which here corresponds to " filtro-opiniones " and you can name your input file accordingly, like in our  case " hotel_test.txt ".
- you have been given flexiblity to choose your own special class(s) for which you specifically want filteration.Here Special    Classes for filteration must be given in string format .
- The text file name
- The output comes in the format of well classified input data.

### Challenges Faced
Test txt files were not easily available
Faced difficulty in analysing the text tables and choosing appropriate keywords.
- 

### Learnings
We learnt to work with python nltk libraries and gained knowledge about natural language processing
